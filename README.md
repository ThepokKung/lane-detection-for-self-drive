# Lane Detection Demo

This project demonstrates lane detection using OpenCV and Python. The script processes images to detect lanes and saves intermediate steps for visualization.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following packages:

- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

Create a folder named `images` and place all the images you want to use in it.

# Usage

1. Place your input images in a folder named `images`.

2. Run the script to process the images and save the results.

```bash
python lane_detection_demo.py
```

The processed images and intermediate steps will be saved in a folder named `lane_detection_steps_all`.
